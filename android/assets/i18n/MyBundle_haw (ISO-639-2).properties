textTutorialPage1=At the top of the screen is a rating timer. The sooner you solve the puzzle the higher the rating. Each puzzle has row and column hints. Each hint is a group of black squares. Whenever we start a puzzle we start with the largest number as those are easiest to solve.
textTutorialPage2=Since there are 5 columns we know each square in this row will be filled in. Once you do that the hint will be disabled to indicate you solved for that row. In addition the first column only has 1 group of 1 square and that is also disabled as it has the correct number of squares.
textTutorialPage3=For squares that will not be filled we can flag so we know they are not part of the solution. Which makes it simple to solve the rest of the puzzle.
textTutorialPage4=Once the puzzle is solved you will see the solution along with your rating.
textTutorialPage5=Here we have a puzzle with multiple groups in the first row. Each group of squares must be separated by at least 1 emtpy square.
textTutorialPage6=This picture shows how each group is separated by at least 1 square. Each group is in proper order. Use the process of elimination to fill in the squares.
textTutorialPage7=Here we are solving a color puzzle. The concept is similar but you will select one of the colors below to fill in the squares.
textTutorialPage8=When you select the color you will see the hints of the same color outlined. Color puzzles can have multiple groups of squares together as long as the colors are different. If the colors are the same there needs to be at least 1 emtpy square separating the groups. Just like the black and white puzzles.
textTutorialPage9=In this picture the first row has 2 groups with each group having 2 green squares. In this case since the colors are the same they have to be separated by at least 1 empty square. For this solution they are separated by 3 empty squares.
textTutorialPage10=This puzzle is a nice day at the beach. Now we can continue to the next puzzle or go back to the main menu.
